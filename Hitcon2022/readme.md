# Thoughts

This was my first official offline CTF competition, hosted by a Taiwanese organization. Initially, I only wanted to complete the tasks required for the external CTF competition, which was part of the Computer Security Fall 2022 course at NTU. However, I discovered that solving the problems was a lot of fun, even though some of them were quite challenging as I was still a newbie to CTF.

During the CTF, I learned about the various modes of CTF and what to expect when participating in a jeopardy CTF mode. This gave me valuable ideas and strategies to prepare for the final exam, which is the AIS EOF 2022 qualification.

Moreover, I found that some of the pwn problems were very difficult, and only expert teams managed to solve them. After reviewing the write-ups by the official and expert teams, I realized that there were some subjects in pwn that were not covered in our courses, such as kernel pwn. This made me aware that there are still many things to explore in the pwn subject.

Finally, even though I only solved two problems and almost solved another, I believe that this was a great start to my journey in Computer Security and CTF.
